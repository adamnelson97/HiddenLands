Note: ALL pieces only move if their destination is unoccupied by both the player and other pieces. If there is another piece there, the piece (that is to be moved) stays put and waits to move next turn.

Piece 1, Wizard:
	Symbol: 'W'. Used to confuse player as it is the same as the Witch.
	Motion: None
	Interaction: HIT. Has range of +/- 2 spaces from current space, i.e. if the Wizard is on space 3, he can hit a target on spaces 1-5. 

Piece 2, Witch:
	Symbol: 'W'. Used to confuse player as it is the same as the Wizard.
	Motion: None
	Interaction: KILL. Has range of +/- 1 space from current space. Gives a warning from 2 spaces away.

Piece 5, Knight:
	Symbol: 'K'
	Motion: Moves Left one space every turn. Skips a space if it is occupied by another piece.
	Interaction: ADVANCE. Only interacts on same space.

Piece 6, Dragon:
	Symbol: 'F'. Uses 'F' for 'Fire' since Dwarves use 'D'.
	Motion: None
	Interaction: NONE. Dragon is 'sleeping', so it only implements Drawable.

Piece 7, Man:

	Motion: None
	Interaction: NONE. The man tells the player the number of hits they can take, and the number of points they need to advance. Has a 1/3 chance of appearing somewhere on the board.
